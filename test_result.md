# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Current cover-generation task (supersedes the older UI entries below):
# User: "Una volta terminato, genera quante più copertine puoi con stessa qualità di quelle già esistenti, ho ricaricato la chiave api"
# Confirmed: use available API credit for missing covers, preserve existing covers, TTS/Stripe off.
# backend implemented / needs_retesting: generate_covers.py checkpointed batch, source originals
# retained in covers/, same Nano Banana model, atomic no-overwrite DB writes, 3 portrait pilot
# covers (volcanoes-basics, why-seasons, how-glaciers-move), remaining batch currently running.
# Before: 437 stories, 132 generated covers + 47 photographic covers, 258 missing.
# Run reports: memory/cover_batches/*.json (existing_covers snapshot, generated, errors, status).
# Added optional_services.py API guard: TTS defaults off independently of image key; Stripe
# already has no key and returns 503. No auth, frontend edits or runtime image generation.
# Test focus: all completed new hero/thumb endpoints decode; existing 179 covers unchanged;
# run --dry-run does not spend credits; lock prevents duplicate execution; portrait quality;
# preview intro -> Home, new cover reader + scroll, old cover still visible; no TTS calls.
# Screenshot smoke: 390x844 intro loaded; pilot images 896x1200 match existing originals.
# No APIs mocked. Do not invoke real image generation during testing; inspect dry-run only.
# FINAL: 194 new covers published; 373/437 covered; 64 missing. Budget stop honored.
# Final pytest: 5/5 PASS, test_reports/pytest/cover_batch_final.xml. 388 new media
# endpoints verified. All original179 preserved. Recovery (4 already-paid originals)
# idempotent, no AI calls. Seed fallback overwrite fixed; TTS/Stripe intentionally off.
# iteration_5 follow-up: test_reports/cover_batch_followup.md explains corrected test
# baseline/process false positives. No unresolved scoped functional bugs.
